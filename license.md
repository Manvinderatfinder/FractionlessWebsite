# Addendum

Why not go GPL like all the cool kids? Becuase: 

* Richard Stallman is a self-serving fundamentalist baby more interested in getting credit and praise rather than looking out for the interests of the FSF for which he is an awful spokesman for.

* The GPL requires that all derived works also be GPL. We can't have that now. We want you to use Fraction.less for profit if you want.

* This one is a bit of repitition of the first point - the GPL gives you the freedom to not make a penny off your work. Don't even try to make the point that you can sell open source software. I could also try to sell air but it wouldn't be very lucrative. Go ahead and use this in projects that make money.

* Free, open source code and the movement is a good thing but there's room in this world for proprietary and open technologies.
